# Temperature-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a Machine Learning model for predicting temperatures based on historical data. The model performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and utilizes various machine learning algorithms. Among these algorithms, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 89%.

- Data Collection: Gathered temperature data from a reliable source, presumably historical temperature records.

- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset that might affect the accuracy of the model.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset using statistical and visual methods to understand patterns, correlations, and insights about the temperature data. This step likely involved visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.

- Data Preprocessing: Prepared the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

- Machine Learning Algorithms: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests to predict temperatures based on historical data. Among these algorithms, the random forest model emerged as the most accurate, achieving an impressive 89% accuracy.

- Model Deployment: Demonstrated the functionality of the trained model by creating an interface where users can input a specific date, and the model predicts the temperature for that day.

- Evaluation and Validation: Assessed the model's performance using evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared to ensure its reliability in making temperature predictions.
